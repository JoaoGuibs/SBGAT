 * @brief  Evaluation of potential, acceleration caused by a constant-density polyhedron
 *
 * @details Computes the potential, acceleration caused by a polyhedron
 of constant density by evaluating the so called Polyhedron Gravity Model as derived by Werner and Scheeres.
 * The input must be a topologically-closed polyhedron.
