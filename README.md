## Changelog

### Sbgat 1.02.1
Sbgat 1.02.1 marks the transition to VTK as SBGAT's backbone. 

* Created SBGATMassProperties, a SBGAT filter computing the surface area, volume, inertia and center of mass of a constant density polyhedron (see [Dobrovolskis, A. R. (1996). Inertia of Any Polyhedron. Icarus, 124, 698â€“704. ](https://doi.org/10.1006/icar.1996.0243])])
* Created SBGATPolyhedronGravityModel, a SBGAT filter computing the acceleration and potential of a constant density, topologically-closed polyhedron polyhedron (see [Werner, R.A. & Scheeres, D.J. Celestial Mech Dyn Astr (1996) 65: 313.](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00053511]))
* Added validation tests for the newly created classes

### Sbgat 1.02.0
Sbgat 1.02 is a first take at fully leveraging VTK data structures for visual props representation and operation. 

Current features of SbgatGUI include: 
* Small body shape model import from `.obj` files
* Trajectory loaded from time-XYZ ascii files. This capability will eventually replaces by SPICE kernels
* Spacecraft shape model import from `.obj` files
* Spacecraft displacement along previously loaded trajectory
* Addition/removal of light sources at arbitrary positions
* Computation of geometric measures such as surface area, volume, bounding boxes, center-of-mass and inertia tensor, the last two assuming a constant density distribution
